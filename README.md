# gardening-game
Design and code a garden design application in Java. It should graphically display a ‘garden’ in a JFrame window. • The ‘garden’ is contained in a JFrame. It should contain other components for graphics, painting etc. • It can have a blank background, or pretty grass/a texture. • It will contain flowerbeds. Flowerbeds display rows of flowers. They can be all the same, or mixed. • If mixed, they could be in patterns, or random. The example below shows 2 plain flowerbeds at the top, and 2 flowerbed patterns below • It is possible to achieve a maximum of 80% without displaying flowers in patterns (ie plain beds with only one type of flower per bed). This would be a good approach for students who have lower coding skills.
